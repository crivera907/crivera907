- 👋 Hi, I’m @crivera907
- 👀 I’m interested in 3D printing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to flash or update the 3d printer software. I have a Wanahoa 3i Duplicator Plus that has lost EPROM.  It was sitting for over a year since I last used it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 3d printing issues, but I am still a rookie.
